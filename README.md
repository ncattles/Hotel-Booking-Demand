# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves data preprocessing and the development of a machine learning model to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not. The dataset used contains information about hotel bookings, and the goal is to create a binary classification model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model predicts whether a booking is likely to be canceled (`is_canceled`: 1) or not canceled (`is_canceled`: 0).

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset to make it suitable for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key aspects of the data.
3. **Model Development**: Implementing the KNN algorithm for binary classification.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model by tuning the number of neighbors.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `hotel_bookings.csv`, which contains booking details such as hotel type, lead time, number of guests, and whether the booking was canceled. The target variable is `is_canceled`, which indicates if the booking was canceled (`1`) or not (`0`).

## Data Preprocessing
### 1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Dropped the `company` column due to a high number of missing values.
   - Removed rows with missing values to ensure a clean dataset.

### 2. **Removing Undefined Meal Data**:
   - Rows with the `Undefined` value in the `meal` column were removed to maintain data integrity.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted `year`, `month`, and `day` from the `reservation_status_date` column.
   - Converted categorical features like `hotel`, `meal`, and `customer_type` into numerical representations using mapping techniques.
   - Generated mappings for countries and other categorical data for better model interpretation.

### 4. **Final Dataset**:
   - The cleaned and transformed dataset was exported to `hotel_bookings_cleaned.csv` for future use.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Several visualizations were generated to gain insights into the dataset, including:

1. **Hotel Types**: Distribution of bookings across different hotel types. ('Resort Hotel': 0, 'City Hotel': 1)

2. **Meal Preferences**: Distribution of meal types among customers. ('BB (bed and breakfast)':0, 'FB (full board)':1, 'HB (half board)':2, 'SC (self catering)':3)

3. **Top Countries**: Countries with the most bookings. ('GBR', 0)('PRT', 1)('USA', 2)('ESP', 3)('IRL', 4)('DEU', 10)('FRA', 11)('BEL', 12)('ITA', 16)('BRA', 23)

4. **Lead Time**: Distribution of lead time (days between booking and arrival). (Number of days that elapsed between the entering date of the booking and the arrival date)

5. **Monthly Bookings**: Trends in booking volume over the year.

6. **Average Daily Rate**: Trends in the average daily rate over time. (the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period)

7. **Cancellation Rates**: The proportion of bookings that were canceled. (Value indicating if the booking was canceled (1) or not (0))

## Modeling
### 1. **Train-Test Split**:
   - The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% test data for model evaluation.

### 2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - KNN was used to build the binary classification model.
   - The initial model used `n_neighbors=5`.

### 3. **Model Training**:
   - The KNN model was trained on the training set and evaluated using the test set.

---

## Evaluation
### 1. **Accuracy**: 
   - The model achieved an accuracy of `85%` on the test set.

### 2. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - The confusion matrix was generated to evaluate the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

### 3. **Classification Report**:
   - Precision, recall, and F1-score were reported for both classes (canceled and not canceled).

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid search was used to find the optimal value for `n_neighbors`:

- Tested values: `[1, 3, 5]`.
- The best value for `n_neighbors` was found to be `1`, with a score of `86%`.
